description: List of Rules and Prizes
---
Ready for this list of AMAZING, one-of-a-kind prizes???!?!?!?!

But FIRST, the rules:

1. One entry per person (unless you buy (or have previously bought) a copy of The Rope That Binds Us. Then you get FIVE. I might even be convinced to give five entries to each person in your party😉)
2. Each person can only win ONE prize. If your name is drawn again, it shall be cast aside for another!
3. This is not a live raffle. The raffle winners will be picked after the event later in the evening.
4. Every entry must have your NAME and your EMAIL ADDRESS for you to qualify. Without these things, I wouldn’t be able to tell you that you won anyway! \
   **Just as an FYI**: There is an option to be part of the email list where you can get updates about author events and such. If you check YES, you will be on the email list. If you check NO, your email will ONLY be used to give you your prize and/or get info of where to send your prize.
5. I will be filming the moment you have been waiting for, when the winners are picked and announced!! You can go on Instagram (@[authorraechelbrowne](https://www.instagram.com/authorraechelbrowne/)) and/or Facebook ([Raechel Browne, Author](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61570502693211)) to see if you won. And to be clear, I WILL NOT share your personal information on the video. Not your email address, nor your last name. I will announce your first name, cuz otherwise I would just be pulling out a ticket and saying, “We have a winner! They have a name! But I will not be naming that name. You just know they have a name and they have won one of these coveted prizes.” Could be entertaining, I guess. 🤷‍♀️
