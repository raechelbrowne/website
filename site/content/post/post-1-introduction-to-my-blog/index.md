Hey all!

This is Raechel.

I‚Äôm not quite sure how to begin so I will probably just babble for a while before getting to the point. Sounds fun, right? 



Bear with me.



I am starting this blog for a few reasons (yay for bullet points!):

* To give an in depth look at my new novel, The Rope That Binds Us 
* To talk about depression and anxiety
* To educate about (on? with? on the subject of? (Good thing I‚Äôm not a professional writer \*wink wink\*)) depression and anxiety
* To have a creative outlet
* To do some ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù-ing (who doesn‚Äôt love an inside look?)
* And, sure, to promote my book. Not gonna lie

And most importantly:

* To help at least one other person who suffers from mental illness to not feel so alone



Still with me?

The compulsively organized part of me wants to do this all chronologically, but that‚Äôs just not going to happen. It‚Äôs like when I was a kid and I‚Äôd get a shiny new journal. I always thought I had to tell my whole life story up until the point I got the journal, then I could get to what was happening in my life currently. I would quit within a few pages. It was overwhelming and unnecessary, which is what putting all this stuff in some sort of orderly fashion would be.

So I will be posting whatever I feel like at the time. Such as (aren‚Äôt bullet points great?):

* Author Life:

  * Events that will happen
  * Events that have happened
  * Exciting updates
  * My process
  * Getting published
  * etc
* How depression has affected different parts of my life, including past and present (some of those will be ‚ÄúOh, life is so wonderful #GratefulForMyTrials‚Äù, while others will be ‚ÄúI hate everything! #ScrewDepression #LifeSucks‚Äù)
* Pictures (but those will mostly be on my Facebook page)
* Chapter \[whatever] of my book:

  * Why I wrote it that way
  * What really happened
  * Diving deeper into what Sohpie (AKA: I) was thinking OR
  * What strikes me about such and such a character (and possibly what they are doing now IRL)

Overwhelmed yet? I am.

It‚Äôs ok. One post at a time. 

Hopefully I will post regularly and/or consistently, but with two hyperactive children, trying to get my degree, keeping my house clean (ha! Ok, clean is relative), doctors appointments, a husband I like spending time with (go figure), teaching tiny humans at church, trying to read all the books on my TBR list, and trying to stay as sane as possible, that might be difficult.



Wish me luck! 



Until Next TIme,

RaeB
