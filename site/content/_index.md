    - quote: '"This was the right mix of reality and *clean* romance. I finished the
        book earlier this week and I loved the description of
        depression/anxiety/darkness it was so raw and accurate. You can tell the
        author has put a lot of personal, emotional work in and reflects in
        accuracy and authenticity of emotion."'
